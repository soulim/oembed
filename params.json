{"body":"# Introductions\r\n\r\n[**oEmbed**](http://oembed.com/) is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third\r\nparty sites. The simple API allows a website to display embedded content\r\n(such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without\r\nhaving to parse the resource directly.\r\n\r\n**oembed gem** is a simple to use and slim (~150 LOC) library to work with oEmbed format. It has no external dependencies at runtime. All you need to have is Ruby itself.\r\n\r\nThe library shares a behaviour of oEmbed client with any Ruby object. Just `include Oembed::Client` into that object and you are good to go.\r\n\r\n**oembed gem** is provider agnostic. It has no pre-configured providers.\r\nYou can build a client for any oEmbed provider of the world :)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'oembed'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install oembed\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nYou have to do a few things to build an oEmbed client with `oembed` gem.\r\n\r\n- `include Oembed::Client` into your object,\r\n- add instance method `#endpoint_uri` to that object. This method has to return\r\n  a string with URI of oEmbed endpoint.\r\n\r\nLets start with a simple example. It will be a client for the awesome\r\n[Speaker Deck](http://speakerdeck.com).\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'oembed'\r\n\r\n# Speaker Deck client\r\nclass SpeakerDeck\r\n  include Oembed::Client\r\n\r\n  # Read more about endpoint on https://speakerdeck.com/faq#oembed\r\n  def endpoint_uri\r\n    'http://speakerdeck.com/oembed.json'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it. Now you can use a method `#fetch` to get data from oEmbed enpoint of Speaker Deck.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclient = SpeakerDeck.new\r\np client.fetch('https://speakerdeck.com/u/soulim/p/rails')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method `#fetch` will return a hash with oEmded data.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\" => \"rich\",\r\n  \"version\" => 1.0,\r\n  \"provider_name\" => \"Speaker Deck\", \r\n  \"provider_url\" => \"https://speakerdeck.com/\",\r\n  \"title\" => \"Локализация приложения на базе Rails. Личный опыт и советы\", \r\n  \"author_name\" => \"Alex Soulim\", \r\n  \"author_url\" => \"https://speakerdeck.com/u/soulim\",\r\n  \"html\" => \"<iframe style=\\\"border:0; padding:0; margin:0; background:transparent;\\\" mozallowfullscreen=\\\"true\\\" webkitallowfullscreen=\\\"true\\\" frameBorder=\\\"0\\\" allowTransparency=\\\"true\\\" id=\\\"presentation_frame_4fd3874cebb4b2001f0277e5\\\" src=\\\"//speakerdeck.com/embed/4fd3874cebb4b2001f0277e5\\\" width=\\\"710\\\" height=\\\"596\\\"></iframe>\\n\",\r\n  \"width\" => 710,\r\n  \"height\" => 596\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the moment `oembed` gem supports the JSON format only. I will fix it soon. Stay tuned! :)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3.
